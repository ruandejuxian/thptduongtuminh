                        <p>In the early days of its establishment, the school's facilities were still lacking. The school was a simple thatched roof built on a sparsely populated deserted hill in Doi Trong ward, Quang Vinh city.</p>
                        <p>In 1987, the school moved to a new location, taking over the premises of Nguyen Minh Phuong Primary School in Quang Vinh Ward, Quang Vinh City.</p>

                    <p>When moving to a new location - No. 123, Duong Tu Minh Street, Quang Tu Ward, Quang Vinh City, to have a suitable name, the school requested the Department of Education and Training and the Provincial People's Committee to change the school's name. On March 28, 1992, the People's Committee of Ha Trung Province issued Decision No. 23/QD - UB to change the name of the Agricultural High School for Part-time Study to Duong Tu Minh High School.</p>
