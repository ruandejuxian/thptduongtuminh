                <h3>Lịch sử hình thành và phát triển</h3>
                  Duong Tu Minh High School was formerly Quang Vinh City Secondary Agricultural High School.

<p>On February 24, 1972, the Ceremony to announce Decision No. 212/TC - UB of the People's Committee of Ha Trung province on the establishment of "Quang Vinh City Secondary Agricultural Secondary School" was under the leadership of the City People's Committee in all aspects, and at the same time under the leadership of the Department of Education in terms of professional expertise. September 20, 1960 was also the opening day of the first course with 108 students.</p>

<p>In the early days of its establishment, the school's facilities were still lacking. The school was a simple thatched roof built on a sparsely populated deserted hill in Doi Trong ward, Quang Vinh city.</p>


<p>In 1987, the school moved to a new location, taking over the premises of Nguyen Minh Phuong Primary School in Quang Vinh Ward, Quang Vinh City.</p>

From the 1990-1992 school year, the school was the first unit in Ha Trung province and one of fifteen schools nationwide to pilot the specialized program. The school has gained a lot of experience in implementing the program and contributed to the Ministry of Education and Training.

<p>When moving to a new location - No. 123, Duong Tu Minh Street, Quang Tu Ward, Quang Vinh City, to have a suitable name, the school requested the Department of Education and Training and the Provincial People's Committee to change the school's name. On March 28, 1992, the People's Committee of Ha Trung Province issued Decision No. 23/QD - UB to change the name of the Agricultural High School for Part-time Study to Duong Tu Minh High School.</p>
